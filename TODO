============================= TODO List =======================================

1. remove /libs from SCM - move to maven for dependency management
   This will involve putting the IOIO files in a maven repo

2. make a build script that will checkout latest IOIO src, compile, rename 
   jars and copy them to given location

3. do the same as #2 but include GraphView
